A sophisticated, AI-powered deceptive honeypot designed to detect, analyze, and mislead attackers. This system goes beyond simple emulation by using LLMs to generate realistic responses, machine learning to classify attacks, and advanced fingerprinting to identify adversaries.

## 🚀 Key Features

The AI Honeypot includes **13 intelligence modules** working in harmony to provide a complete threat detection and analysis platform:

### 🧠 Advanced Intelligence
- **LLM-Powered Responses**: Generates realistic, context-aware content to keep attackers engaged.
- **ML Attack Classification**: Uses machine learning to classify attacks and detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Identifies attacker skill levels (Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Automated).
- **Campaign Detection**: correlates multi-vector attacks and tracks campaigns across sessions.

### 🛡️ Deception & Evasion
- **Realistic Latency**: Simulates natural processing delays (50-800ms) to avoid detection as a honeypot.
- **Fake Vulnerabilities**: Intentionally exposes fake flaws to lure attackers into revealing their methods.
- **Canary Tokens**: Embeds unique, trackable tokens in responses (credentials, API keys) to detect data leaks.
- **Tool Poisoning**: Specifically targets and confuses common attack tools like SQLMap and Burp Suite.

### 📊 Monitoring & Analysis
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live visualization of attacks, traffic, and threat metrics via WebSocket.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrates with AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal for external IP reputation scoring.
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Advanced tracking using Canvas, WebGL, and AudioContext fingerprinting.
- **Interactive Shell**: specific simulation of a compromised environment with fake file system and admin panels.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/madhurgrover-cs/ai-honepot.git
    cd ai-honepot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Honeypot

Start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The honeypot will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

### Accessing the Dashboard

Visit `http://localhost:8000/dashboard` to view the real-time attack monitor.

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the honeypot's functionality, run the included test suite:
```bash
python test_honeypot.py
```

You can also manually simulate attacks:

*   **SQL Injection**: `curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=' OR 1=1--"`
*   **Admin Access**: `curl "http://localhost:8000/admin"`
*   **XSS Attempt**: `curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>"`

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is designed to work out-of-the-box with sensible defaults.

### External Threat Intelligence
To enable AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal integration, you can configure your API keys in `external_threat_intel.py` or call `configure_threat_intel()` in your startup script.

### Alerts
Webhooks for Slack and Discord can be configured in `alerts.py`.
